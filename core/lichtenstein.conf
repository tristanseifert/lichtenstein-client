# Basic client configuration
[client]
# Port on which the lichtenstein client operates. You should never need to change
# this, but if you do, ensure all nodes on the network know that that's the new
# port.
#
# Default: 7420
port = 7420

# Address on which the server listens to requests. You may need to change this
# if there are multiple interfaces on the server.
#
# Default: 0.0.0.0
listen = 0.0.0.0

# IP address to advertise to the server. If this isn't specified, we'll try to
# make an educated guess (if the listen IP address is specified, we use that)
# but it may be wrong on systems with multiple interfaces.
#
# Default: 0.0.0.0
advertiseAddress = 0.0.0.0

# Multicast group used for discovery and synchronization. This group is joined
# when the client starts. You should never need to change this, but if you do,
# ensure that all nodes on the network are also configured for this multicast
# group.

# Default: 239.42.0.69

# How many seconds to wait after the server initially starts up before sending a

# Settings to control the output channels.
[output]
# Maximum amount of time to wait for any single channel to be ready to output.

# used by the client itself aside for informing the server.

# Parameters to control logging output. All logs are written to the specified

# be adjusted.
[logging]
# Log file
#
# Default: "", no logging to file takes place
file = ./lichtenstein.log

# Verbosity of logging; negative values indicate verbose logging, whereas a
# positive value indicates the lowest log level to output. (info messages are 0,
